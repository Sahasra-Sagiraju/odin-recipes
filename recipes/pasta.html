        <h2>About Pasta</h2>
        <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple
        food of Italian cuisine. Mexican pasta is a great vegetarian dish with a kick!</p>
