        <h2>About Pasta</h2>
        <p>Petya's friend (whose name is not known), made some pasta for them to eat. He then boasted that nobody can make better pasta then him. Petya the chef, didn't like his arrogance and decided to prove him wrong. So, he went home and started experimenting in his kitchen. He tried for many years but failed to come up with a better recipe. He was sad...
        </p>
        <p>So, he decided to go on a trip to his favorite place on the planet, <strong>Mexico</strong>. On his visit there, he observed many street food vendors. And one day, something clicked in his mind. He rushed home and made the most delicious pasta ever. He named it <strong>Mexican Pasta</strong>.
